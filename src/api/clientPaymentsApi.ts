 *
 *   POST /v1/checkout/sessions                   — create Stripe Checkout session
 *                                                  (checkout.controller.ts:94)
 *   POST /v1/checkout/billing-portal             — Stripe Billing Portal URL
 *                                                  (checkout.controller.ts:207)
 *   GET  /v1/checkout/sessions/:id/confirm       — confirm a returned session
 *                                                  (checkout.controller.ts:236)
 *   GET  /v1/checkout/entitlement                — current entitlement flag
 *                                                  (checkout.controller.ts:168)
 *   GET  /v1/checkout/purchases                  — client's purchase history
 *                                                  (checkout.controller.ts:147)
 *
 * Plus the client packages list (separate controller, verified against
 * `growth-project-backend/src/packages/packages.controller.ts:161`):
 *   GET  /v1/clients/me/coach/packages           — packages the coach offers this client
 *
 * History — round 1: four checkout-shaped calls pointed at
 * `/v1/clients/me/coach/*` paths that don't exist on the backend; every
 * call 404'd and the 404 was swallowed as "not_configured".
 *
 * History — round 2 (per audit): the round-1 fix invented
 * `GET /v1/checkout/status` (also dead) and missed rewiring
 * `getEntitlement` (`/v1/clients/me/coach/entitlement` → `/v1/checkout/entitlement`).
 *
 * History — round 3 (THIS revision, per audit): the round-2 derivation
 * referenced a fabricated `is_current` field on the `CoachPackage` row
 * that does not exist in the backend Prisma schema
 * (`growth-project-backend/prisma/schema.prisma:2942-3000`), so the
 * "Current plan" pill and `package_name` were always null. Round 3
 * derives status from the REAL `GET /v1/checkout/purchases` response:
 * the `ClientPurchase` Prisma row carries `entitlement_active`,
 * `status`, `current_period_end`, `package_id`, `cancel_at_period_end`
 * — every field the screen needs, with the package_name joined from
 * `getPackages()` by `package_id`. No invented fields.
 *
 * Envelope: only a 501 collapses into
 * `{ ok: false, reason: 'not_configured' }`. A 404 is treated as a real
 * transport/path failure and surfaced as `{ ok: false, reason: 'error' }`
 * so the UI can offer a retry instead of silently telling the buyer their
 * coach hasn't enabled payments. The true "no plans / not connected"
 * state is derived from explicit signal — never from a 404 on a broken
 * route.
 *
 * Dunning gap: the `DunningState` table
 * (`growth-project-backend/prisma/schema.prisma:3424`) exists, but no
 * client-facing route reads it today. `dunning` is null on every page-load
 * response. The past-due banner in `ClientPackagesScreen` is wired and
 * ready; it will light up once the backend ships a dunning route.
 * TODO(backend): expose `GET /v1/checkout/dunning` (or fold dunning
 * fields into the purchases response) so the mobile past-due banner can
 * render real data instead of always-null.
 *
 * Checkout return / cancel deep-links are handled by the navigator
 * (`com.growthproject.app://checkout/success` and
 * `com.growthproject.app://checkout/cancel`); this module only speaks HTTP.

   * (`prisma/schema.prisma:3424`). The screen's past-due banner is
   * wired and will light up when the backend ships a dunning read route.
   * TODO(backend): expose `GET /v1/checkout/dunning` (or include dunning
   * fields on the purchases response) so this null becomes real data.

   * ships it. Until then a real 404 is surfaced as a retryable error

   * the empty "No deliverables yet" state).
